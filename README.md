Information Storage and Retrieval course project phase 2:
This program reads an input file of multiple documents separated with \<p>, tokenizes them, stems the tokens using Paice/Husk algorithm, and creates a dictionary of the results.
The user can search a word in the document set. The program uses tf-idf to find the matching documents for the input vector.
